# Caching Algorithms

This directory explores various caching algorithms commonly used in computer science and software engineering. Caching algorithms are essential for improving the performance of systems by storing frequently accessed data in a cache to reduce the need for expensive operations such as disk or network access.

## Introduction

Caching algorithms play a crucial role in improving the efficiency and speed of systems that rely on frequent data access. These algorithms determine how data is stored and evicted from a cache based on certain rules and principles.

This repository provides Python implementations of popular caching algorithms, including LIFO, FIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU. Each algorithm has its own approach to managing the cache and deciding which items to keep or remove.

## Caching Algorithms

### LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)

The LIFO caching algorithm, also known as the Last-In, First-Out algorithm, evicts the most recently added item when the cache is full. It assumes that the most recently accessed items are more likely to be accessed again in the near future.

### FIFO (First-In, First-Out)

The FIFO caching algorithm, also known as the First-In, First-Out algorithm, evicts the oldest item in the cache when the cache is full. It follows the principle that the items that have been in the cache the longest are the least likely to be accessed in the future.

### LRU (Least Recently Used)

The LRU caching algorithm, also known as the Least Recently Used algorithm, evicts the least recently used item when the cache is full. It assumes that the items that have not been accessed for the longest time are the least likely to be accessed again.

### MRU (Most Recently Used)

The MRU caching algorithm, also known as the Most Recently Used algorithm, evicts the most recently used item when the cache is full. It assumes that the items that have been accessed most recently are likely to be accessed again soon.

### LFU (Least Frequently Used)

The LFU caching algorithm, also known as the Least Frequently Used algorithm, evicts the least frequently used item when the cache is full. It tracks the frequency of item accesses and removes the item with the lowest access frequency.
